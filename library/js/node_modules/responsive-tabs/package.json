  "readme": "jQuery Responsive Tabs\n==============\n\nThis jQuery plugin provides responsive tab functionality. The tabs transform to an accordion when it reaches a CSS breakpoint.\nCheck out a demo at http://jellekralt.github.io/Responsive-Tabs/demo.html\n\nFeatures\n=========\n\n+ Tabs transform to accordion based on breakpoint\n+ Uses javascript / jQuery for the technical tab switching (class based)\n+ Uses CSS for the desktop/tablet/mobile view\n+ Has callback events for the tab events\n+ Tabs can be opened with URL hashes\n+ Tabs can auto rotate\n+ Tabs can be collapsed (optional)\n+ Tabs can start collapsed based on the view (optional)\n+ Cross browser compatibility (IE7+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera)\n+ Multiple device support (Web, Tablet, Mobile, etc)\n\n\nHow to use\n==========\n\n=> Requires jQuery (minimaly jQuery 1.7.0)\n=> Include jquery.responsiveTabs.js\n=> Include responsive-tabs.css for the basic Tabs to Accordion switching\n=> Include style.css for a basic tab/accordion theme\n\n=> Use this HTML markup:\n\n    <div id=\"responsiveTabsDemo\">\n        <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"#tab-1\"> .... </a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#tab-2\"> .... </a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#tab-3\"> .... </a></li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div id=\"tab-1\"> ....... </div>\n        <div id=\"tab-2\"> ....... </div>\n        <div id=\"tab-3\"> ....... </div>\n    </div>\n\n=> Use this jQuery function to enable responsive tabs on the selected element:\n\n    $('#responsiveTabsDemo').responsiveTabs({\n        startCollapsed: 'accordion'\n    });\n\nInstall\n=======\n\n### npm\n\n    npm install responsive-tabs\n    \n    \nAPI\n===\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n### Collapsible\nIf set to 'true' the panels are collapsible. The values 'tabs' and 'accordion' can be used to make the panels collapsible in a specific view/state. If a tab is active and you select it again, the panel will collapse.\n\n        collapsible: false // The panels are not collapsible\n        collapsible: true // The panels are collapsible\n        collapsible: 'tabs' // The panels are only collapsible if the view is currently tab based\n        collapsible: 'accordion' // The panels are only collapsible if the view is currently accordion based\n\n### Start collapsed\nThis option defines if the first panel on load starts collapsed or not. With the values 'tabs' and 'accordion' you can specify in which view the tabs are supposed to start collapsed.\n\n        startCollapsed: false // Do not collapse on start\n        startCollapsed: true // Start with the panels collapsed\n        startCollapsed: 'tabs' // Start with the panels collapsed if the view is currently tab based\n        startCollapsed: 'accordion' // Start with the panels collapsed if the view is currently accordion based\n\n### Rotate\nThis option can be used to auto rotate the tabs. The tabs will stop rotating when a tab is selected.\n\n        rotate: false, // The tabs won't auto rotate\n        rotate: true, // The tabs will auto rotate from the start\n\n### Animation\nThis option enables the animation of the panels. By default the panels will just show and hide, this option can be used to make the panels slide up and down and fade in and out.\n\n        animation: 'fade', // The panels will fade in and out\n        animation: 'slide', // The panels will slide up and down\n\nCallbacks\n---------\n\n### Activate\nThis callback is called after a tab is selected\n\n        activate: function(){},\n\n### Deactivate\nThis callback is called after a tab is deactivated\n\n        deactivate: function(){},\n\n### Load\nThis callback is called after the plugin has been loaded\n\n        load: function(){},\n\n### Activate State\nThis callback is called after the plugin switches from state (Tab view / Accordion view)\n\n        activateState: function(){}\n\nToDo\n====\nI am planning on adding these options in the future:\n- Ajax panels\n- Tabs that can be disabled\n- Keyboard interaction\n- Selection event type (for instance, mouseover)\n\nIf you have good ideas / tips about options / functionality, let me know!\n\nCredits\n=========\nThe idea for this plugin is based on 'Easy Responsive Tabs to Accordion' by samsono (github.com/samsono)\n\nhttps://github.com/samsono/Easy-Responsive-Tabs-to-Accordion\n\nSupport\n=======\nIf you have any questions, problems or suggestions, feel free to submit a ticket!\n",
